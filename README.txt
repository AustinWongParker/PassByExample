Pass by value - The function copies the variable and works with a copy(so it doesn't change anything in the original variable)

Pass by reference - The function uses the original variable, if you change the variable in the other function, it changes in the original variable too.

Example(copy and use/try this yourself and see) : see PassByRefvsValue.cpp
